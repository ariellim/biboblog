I have added phpunit to the project through composer already.

You will have to install the database by either dumping the SQL file I included in the project or using cakephp migrations.

To use cakephp migrations, update the database settings on [project_root]/config/app.php with your local db credentials for both default and test database, 

change directory to [project_root]/bin

Then run "cakephp migrations migrate"

Running phpunit on cakephp is straight forward.

After installing PHPUnit on cakephp using composer 

Using command prompt or shell, change directory to project root.

Then run: phpunit tests

Test results should appear on your screen.
